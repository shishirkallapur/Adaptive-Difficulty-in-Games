# CS5100 Team 9 FAI Project

## Adaptive Difficulty in Games: Leveraging Reinforcement Learning for Player-Driven Immersion
This is our final project source code for CS5100 Fall 2023 under Professor Rajagopal Venkatesaramani.We proposed a project that aims to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create games that adapt to each playerâ€™s unique strengths, weaknesses, and preferences of players. We also proposed an Adversarial RL system to test both "player" and "environment" working together, where the player is trying to clear levels with
ease whereas the "environment" is continuously learning the "player"s skills to make levels more difficult. The advantage of this system is twofold, one being making the "player" agent robust against any environment and second is to automate game testing without manual labour.
